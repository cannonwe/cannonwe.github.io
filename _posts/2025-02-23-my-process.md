## My Process

First and foremost, all credit goes to <a href=https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html> Chad Baldwin for this post, which provides the GitHub template that made this blog possible</a>.  His post describes all the steps to setting up a blog just like this one very quickly and easily.

One of the reasons I decided to make my blog using GitHub pages was that... well, I wanted a blog.  But ultimately, this seemed like the simplest and most sensible option for me.  I can edit this blog completely from my terminal - right now I'm writing this post in Neovim and sipping a coffee.  Once I've made the post, I can simply save the file, do a ```git add, git commit, git push``` and the page populates all by itself, thanks (once again) to the lovely template provided by Chad Baldwin, whose blog I must once more recommend highly.

One thing I'm really excited about when it comes to this setup is the ease at which I can now draft blog posts while on the go - even without a network connection, all I need is a simple text editor and I can draft up very pretty blogposts despite my lack of artistic skill or taste.  Actually, the blogposts are mainly 100% plaintext - the only markup I've used in this post (or at all) is the hyperlink further up, which of course uses an ```<a href>``` tag, which is probably pushing the extent of my markup savvy.

What I'm finding now is that I need a new project, which I find is the toughest phase to be in.  It's challenging (for me, at least) to zero in on the next thing I want to do, even though I do know I want to do <i>something</i>.  I guess in itself that is the new project - to find a new project.  I might try to find an open source project to contribute to, or... maybe I can think of something to write up as a solo process.  Whatever the case is, it'll doubtlessly be written about in this blog - if you're visiting from the future, you'll be able to see right now if I ever actually managed to accomplish anything.  Here's hoping, future reader, that when you go to my github page you'll see that it's bustling with activity and well-written code.  We can only pray.

Ultimately what I find myself wanting to do is to just simply write code that people can actually find useful.  I'm not as interested in video game development now as I used to be.  There's something really gratifying about producing something that actually makes someone's life easier in some way.  What I find challenging is that I live in an age where all the "obvious" things have already been made, if that makes sense.  So I guess I need to either think of something completely outside the box, or find something that I think could be done even better.  We'll see, I suppose.

I think it's a good time to sign off before I ramble on too much more.

Cheers

## This is my first post! 

I'm going to keep it simple, as I don't have much to say.  I've been going through the process of setting up this blog via github pages, and I've just about got it configured.  I'm just hoping I have enough interesting thoughts to justify having a blog to begin with!  

As I sit, I'm about halfway through my morning coffee (although it's nearly noon).  I'm sitting at my laptop watching my 1 year old son play with my wife.  Just dreaming up what my next project will be.  

Recently I've written a piece of software for the Goldeneye Netplay community (yes, that exists) to allow them to verify the integrity of their savefiles so the netplay will sync properly.  I wrote it in Rust - I've very recently taken up writing Rust, and I've been quite enjoying it.  I've got another project on the go just messing around with SQLite in Rust, still thinking of something interesting to actually do with it.  It's interesting - I had written exclusively C for so many years (at least a decade) that I never really expected to enjoy writing Rust, but I did want to give it a shot, and honestly it's been some of the most fun I've had coding in a very long time.  I've tried other languages over the years, but I always get bogged down and switch back to C.  This time, Rust has really taken a hold on me and I feel more productive than ever.  So here's to seeing if the Rust honeymoon period persists.

That about does it for one blog post, largely about nothing at all.  Thanks for reading, if you did, and hopefully there will be many more.

Cheers
